# TASK8
Transformed Dates & Months:

Used Power Query to increment months using an Index column, starting from 01-02-2022 and moving forward to 01-03-2022, 01-04-2022, etc.

Created a new Month column using Date.MonthName and trimmed it to 3-letter format (Feb, Mar, etc.).

Visuals Added:

Bar Chart: Compared Bonus by Employee Name, grouped by Job Level.

Column Chart: Displayed Average Bonus by Job Level.

(Optional) Treemap: Visualized total bonus contributions by individuals and levels in a single visual.

Interactivity:

Added slicers (e.g., by Job Level) to filter visuals dynamically.

Used color highlights to emphasize top bonus recipients.
